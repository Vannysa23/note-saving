# 🗒️ My Secure Notes (Vue Practice Project)

🌱 About This Project

Hey there! 👋
This is a small project I built while practicing Vue.js and learning how to make my web apps more secure.

The idea is simple — a note-taking app where you can quickly write down thoughts, meeting notes, or anything that pops into your head. It’s clean, easy to use, and a good playground for trying out Vue features and some web security basics.
This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite.

✨ What It Can Do
📝 Add, edit, and delete notes
⚡ Fast and responsive
🔒 Focuses on better security — sanitizing inputs, safe data handling, etc.
💻 Works great for quick reminders or meeting notes
🎨 Simple and user-friendly UI
